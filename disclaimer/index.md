<b>When did the law change and who enforces it?</b>

<p>The original EU legislation that became known as the &ldquo;E-Privacy Directive&ldquo; was published in 2003 and implemented as European Directive - 2002/58/EC. It was concerned quite widely with the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector. In 2009 the Directive was amended by Directive 2009/136/EC that included a requirement to seek consent for cookies and similar technologies. The EU Directive entered UK law on 26th May 2011 as &ldquo;The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) Regulations 2011&rdquo;. It is regulated by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) www.ico.gov.uk who decided that enforcement would commence from 26th May 2012.</p>

<b>What are cookies?</b>

<p>A cookie is used by a website to send 'state information' to a Users' browser and for the browser to return the state information to the website. The state information can be used for authentication, identification of a User session, User preferences, shopping cart contents, or anything else that can be accomplished through storing text data on the User's computer.</p>

<p>Cookies cannot be programmed, cannot carry viruses, and cannot install malware on the host computer. However, they can be used to track users' browsing activity which was a major privacy concern that prompted European and US law makers to take action.</p>

<p>Cookies are used by most websites for a variety of reasons - often very practical reasons to do with the operation of the website. However, they are also used to monitor how people are using the website (which pages are visited and how long is spent on each page). Each &quot;visitor session&quot; is tracked even though no effort is made to try to identify them in person.</p>

<p>The new legislation now states that you must be able to opt-out from having cookies stored on their computer. What happens if you disable cookies (i.e. opt-out)?</p>

<p>If you decide to disable cookies we record this so you don't get asked the question again. You will find that most of the website works as expected although functions that rely on cookies are obviously disabled. These functions include using online forms (e.g. our enquiry form) or any feature that requires login.</p>

<p><b>What happens if you ignore the question?</b></p>

<p>If you ignore the question the website will continue to set cookies as necessary. This approach of &quot;implied opt-in&quot; is specifically discussed and approved in the guidance notes issued by the Information Commissioner's Office (the organisation charged with enforcement of this legislation).</p>

<h3><b>Green Policy</b></h3><br>
<b>Our commitment</b><br>
At The Changing Workplace we are committed to protecting our environment. We encourage a positive attitude towards environmentally-friendly policies and practices in the workplace and we implement a comprehensive environmental management system throughout our business.

We believe that making small steps to improve environmental performance at work is easy and results in cost savings, not only for the company but more importantly, for the environment as well.

We continually review, amend and update our environmental policy to ensure that we continue to achieve our goal to protect and preserve our environment.



We aim to comply fully with our legal obligations, and other requirements to which the company subscribes, to prevent harm to the environment.

We strive to improve the company's environmental performance and achieve best environmental practice within the industry, by the efficient use of materials and energy and by monitoring our energy usage and setting targets based on a policy of continual improvement.

We task specified personnel within the company with the responsibility for implementing this policy.
Such specified personnel ensure that all energy readings are submitted to the provider on the last day of each month in order to maintain accurate billing.

We make use of the Workplace Footprint Tracker to monitor energy consumption levels and identify any fluctuations in energy usage either long or short term.

We engage the cooperation of our employees through consultation and through the promotion of this policy.

We seek to develop a greater knowledge and awareness of our environmental responsibilities.

We minimise our landfill contribution through the recycling of aluminium cans, paper and plastic containers.

We promote environmental responsibility in our dealings with all our stakeholders.

We seek to demonstrate our commitment to understanding the effects our business has on the environment and, if appropriate, take measures to address areas of weakness.

We do not pollute the environment with respect to air emissions, waste water, the generation of solid, hazardous, special or clinical waste, the handling of hazardous materials, noise or by contaminating soil or groundwater.

We do not have business activities which result in odour, dust or vibration.

We do not store or manufacture ozone-depleting substances or polychlorinated biphenyls.

<b>We encourage all staff to contribute to our commitment to protecting the environment by implementing the following office policy: </b>

*   Use double-sided/multipage printing for correspondence and reports
*   Don't print emails unless absolutely necessary
*   Print essential emails on a two per page format
*   Reuse scrap paper for telephone messages or notes
*   Purchase recycled or recycled content paper instead of virgin paper where possible
*   Reuse envelopes for internal circulation
*   Use notice boards and emails instead of sending paper memos to staff
*   Put on an additional layer rather than turn up the thermostat on the central heating system
*   Use glasses and mugs rather than throw-away plastic/paper cups
*   Switch off lights and office machinery when not in use and always at night and weekends
*   Ensure power-down facilities on electrical equipment are activated
*   Appoint an environmental coordinator to focus on promoting a greener office and organising ways to improve our environmental performance
*   Recycle printer cartridges
*   Make maximum use of natural light and thereby reduce reliance on artificial, electrically powered lighting
*   Use energy saving lights where possible
*   Use automatic switch-off lights where possible
*   Ensure draught excluders are fitted to external doors
*   Wash out aluminium drinks cans and milk containers and placing them in the appropriate recycling containers
*   All types of office paper and plotter paper (but not newspapers, directories, window envelopes, glossy literature or cardboard), including sensitive and confidential, to be placed in secure bins around the office which are collected monthly, shredded and recycled
*   Reduce the amount of junk mail received by contacting the Mailing Preference Service on www.mpsonline.org.uk
*   Buy energy efficient products
*   Collect milk container lids for Naomi House Children's Hospice
*   The Changing Workplace also participates in the Cycle2Work scheme, whereby we provide staff with a new bicycle and the appropriate cycling safety equipment (so long as the main use of the bike is for commuting to work). This government scheme enables employees to save around 40% of the cost of a new bike and encourages a healthier, more environmentally-friendly commute to work!
