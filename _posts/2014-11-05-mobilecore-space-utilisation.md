<b>CASE STUDY – (Education Sector client)</b>
 
<b>Requirement: </b>

Our client is working with a leading University in the north of England who require annual space utilisation surveys. These feed into the information
provided to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) as part of the Estates Management Record. A big focus was on utilisation to see which rooms were
actually being used once they had been booked.

<b>Facilities stats:</b>

Surveys took place over a one week period and covered 6 campuses, 29 buildings, 16 floors, 388 rooms and 12,970 workstations over an area of 1M+ sq ft.

<b>Key drivers:</b>

*	Streamlining the survey process and meeting HESA legal requirements
*	Reporting was crucial – the ability to turn data into actionable information
*	Empowering staff to make strategic decisions, concentrating on core activity

<b>Implementation:  </b>

After initial meetings and scoping to define requirements and timescales, the MobileCoRE ‘Surveys on the move’ app was populated with the utilisation
survey data ready for simple reporting.

<b>Benefits:</b>

*	Optimum space usage and allocation identified
*	HESA data extracted and available for submission
*	Time/money savings and reduced carbon footprint
*	Reporting influences current provision and future planning
*	Evidence-driven analysis and understanding of estate performance

<b>The Results: </b>

        "It provides the opportunity for evaluation and review by identifying areas for change and further opportunities, either in a University or in any
        public sector or corporate environment. You don’t just get the data, you get a full service with initiation, planning, implementation, analysis and
        review.”</i>
