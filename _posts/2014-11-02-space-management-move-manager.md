<b>CASE STUDY – (Transport Sector client)</b>

<b>Requirement:</b>

Our client is a large transport management organisation who needed a phased, two-stage portfolio implementation of our Space Management module.

<b>Facilities stats:</b>

2.5 million sq ft portfolio with over 1.4 million sq ft of corporate office estate, over 14,000 desks, 43 Corporate Offices. Potentially over 1,000 assets not limited to Corporate Offices, these include Training Centres, Route Operating Control Centres with various facility necessities.

<b>Key drivers:</b>

*	Being able to re-charge space as required
*	Consistent and clear understanding of occupancy
*	Management and production of CRE/FM financial reports (for finance teams)

<b>Implementation:</b>

Following a full initiation, feasibility and planning phase, CWP began by adding a small portfolio to WebCoRE and gradually updating and adding to it. The beauty of WebCoRE is that it can easily be scaled up or down as required. 

<b>Benefits:</b>

*	Client now gets reports for finance teams on building costs
*	Move Manager now aligned with Space Management module place
*	Instant reporting on occupancy, utilisation and churn 
*	Perfect solution for a growing portfolio
*	Head Office is an agile building and we are exploring and developing
further options for occupancy and utilisation measurement

Because of this our client were able to make more buildings agile and see this as the way forward, opting for a 10 people to 7 desk ratio.

<b>The Results:</b> 

<h5><i>“I can’t think of anything which has had such a positive effect on our workplace than WebCoRE. It is certainly making positive in-roads as a support mechanism to our business due to the fact now our moves and changes can now be supported by consistent documentation.”</i></h5>
