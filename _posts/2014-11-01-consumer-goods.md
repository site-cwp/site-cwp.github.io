<b>CASE STUDY – (Consumer Goods Client)</b>

<b>Requirement:</b>

Our client required support with drawing implementation including standardisation and polylining of CAD drawings. This was in preparation for upload to an IWMS system and a very fast turnaround was needed and reassurance that deadlines were achievable.

<b>Facilities stats:</b> 

5M sq ft standardised and uploaded across 12 sites.

<b>Key drivers:</b>

*	To use an organisation with proven industry knowledge and experience
*	BAU drawing office needed to support ongoing maintenance
*	Accurate and fast standardisation to agreed standards

<b>Implementation:</b>

Having submitted and won the tender pitch, our CAD bureau services team set about organising and allocating resources as needed to manage peaks and troughs. A flexible solution was provided so that our client was only charged for what they used and required.

<b>Benefits:</b>

*	Consolidation and standardisation of all CAD drawings
*	Version control now in the same format on all documents
*	Cost effective solution as client only paid for what was required
*	Continuity - all floor plans stored and managed with same processes
*	Focus on core business activity possible for client due to outsourcing

Because of this our client were able to make more buildings agile and see this as the way forward, opting for a 10 people to 7 desk ratio.

<b>The Results:</b> 

<h5><i>"We awarded our CAD bureau standardisation, polylining and upload project to The Changing Workplace based on their capabilities and experience. Due to the heavy volume of work and aggressive timescales we needed a company that could take on the entire project scope, deliver on time and within agreed budgets. 

The project was extremely well managed and we were delighted with the recommendations made, the professional approach and regular communications to ensure our team was aware of progress. I’d have absolutely no hesitation in recommending The Changing Workplace’s first-class CAD bureau service."</i></h5>
