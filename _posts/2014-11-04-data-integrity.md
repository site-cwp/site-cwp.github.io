<b>Data Integrity</b>

As a result of the economic challenges of the past few years, organisations are much more aware – and appreciative – of the role real estate management can play in impacting monetary outlays and driving financial performance. 

This paper outlines four key steps to global industry best practice for data integrity. It explains practical approaches that corporate real estate managers can take in order to achieve the assurance that data is consistent, trustworthy and can be reconciled.

Data integrity is the single most effective route to achieve optimal value of the capital invested, increase top-line revenue and encourage re-use of key knowledge and best practices. But only a centralised, integrated approach can deliver true data integrity for real estate management.

However, while most global organisations today have implemented a Computer Aided Facilities Management (CAFM) or some form of Integrated Workspace Management System (IWMS), many will also have experienced the limitations of these systems. In most cases the information required for effective real estate management still sits in disconnected silos within the enterprise.
