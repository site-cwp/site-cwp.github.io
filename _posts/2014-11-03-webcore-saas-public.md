<b>Requirement:</b>

Our client needed a ‘Software as a Service’ provider to ensure that the allocation, provision, use and cost of space meet all of their known business requirements. They wanted to move from a proprietary drawing and CAFM system to an AutoCAD format with an industry standard database.

<b>Facilities stats:</b>

3 million sqft, 13,500+ employees managed, over 500 buildings and 10,000 workstations.

<b>Key drivers:</b>

*	Ensure decision-influencing information can be accessed by wider audience
*	Adopt a web-based solution that can integrate with other databases
*	Take the lead on innovation and best practice

<b>Implementation:</b>

WebCoRE was customised to meet requirements in a matter of weeks.  At the beginning of the project it was agreed that whilst the data migration took place, a consistent reporting service was maintained using the existing system. A seamless transition was achieved by keeping a small team working with the old drawings and standards until the switchover.

<b>Benefits:</b>

*	Effectively plan for future CRE/FM requirements
*	Gain a clear view of current space usage
*	Heightened focus on standardising data and drawings to IPD 
*	Best-practice principles applied from other client transitions
*	Efficiencies improved and an increased ROI achieved

<b>Testimonial:</b>

<h5>
	<i>“We were impressed with the flexibility of The Changing Workplace, especially when we asked for changes to the original specification once the implementation was under way and we could see where modifications would benefit both us and The Changing Workplace’s CAFM team”.
	<br><br>
	"The flexibility and customisation opportunities of WebCoRE mean we've now got exactly the kind of system we'd hoped for.”</i>
