<b>Requirement:</b>

Our client wanted a proven Software as a Service solution and the knowledge that we worked for other multi-national organisations. Like many other clients, they were keen to use our management service where all data maintenance is managed by CWP, and this was taken into account in the planning of the solution.

<b>Facilities stats:</b>

80,000 staff and 22M sqft, 300 properties across a global property portfolio.

<b>Key drivers:</b>

*	Simple and cost effective solution was required
*	Software needed to be 100% web-based for space and churn management
*	A flexible product that could be added to and amended as required

<b>Implementation:</b>

Plans were submitted to the client in the form of storyboards, demo software and a cost-benefit analysis which were discussed and approved and an implementation schedule agreed. Implementation was broken into two parts: the collection of data and rollout of service and the ongoing maintenance of the database.
 
<b>Benefits:</b>

*	Central hub for management and maintenance of global portfolio
*	Highly customised client-specific Software as a Service solution
*	Accurate and automatic data analysis for real-time reporting 
*	Immediate overview and tracking of portfolio occupancy
*	Simple monitoring of churn/facilitation of moves

<b>The Results:</b>

A highly-tailored client-specific solution, providing our client with a central hub for the management and maintenance of their global portfolio.
