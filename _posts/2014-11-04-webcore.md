WebCoRE is a web-based CAFM system with a suite of modules that help corporate real estate teams manage and report on their portfolios.

Hosted on a fully resilient and secure infrastructure, clients have the option of hosting on a shared cloud, or for even more security a dedicated private cloud. Access to the system can be secured further using a VPN connection allowing access only from your corporate network.

A ‘Software as a Service’ solution with cloud computing as the infrastructure technology is the way forward for modern, lean-led companies.
